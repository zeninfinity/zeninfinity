## Hi, I'm Z. 

I'm an engineer with experience building scalable web applications.  

Toolset:

- **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, SASS, Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python, Django, RESTful APIs, WebSockets
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, TimescaleDB, SQLite, Redis
- **DevOps:** Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI), BASH scripting, Terraform, Ansible, nginx, Apache

I also bring a strong foundation in **systems engineering** - architecting reliable, maintainable systems with long-term scalability and performance in mind.

Combined with an **MBA**, I bridge the technical and business worlds. I understand how engineering decisions affect product strategy, costs, and long-term growth. I'm not just building feature - I'm building sustainable, valuable businesses.
