# Hi, I'm Z. 👨‍💻

I'm an engineer with experience in building scalable web applications working with: 

- Frontend: React, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Python, Django
- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, TimescaleDB
- DevOps: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD Pipelines

In addition to my technical expertise, I hold an MBA and have a strong background in systems engineering. This combination allows me to approach problems not only from a technical perspective but also with a deep understanding of business processes, strategy, and leadership.

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between engineering and business, and I'm always looking for opportunities where I can contribute to both the technical and strategic growth of a company.
