## Hi, I'm Z. 

I'm an engineer with an MBA, bridging the technical and business worlds.  

I bring a deep, strong foundation in **systems engineering** - architecting reliable, maintainable systems with long-term scalability and performance in mind.  I also understand how engineering decisions affect product strategy, costs, and long-term growth. I don't just fix servers and code, I build sustainable, valuable businesses.

🧰 Toolset:

- **DevOps:** Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI), BASH scripting, Terraform, Ansible, nginx, Apache
- **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, SASS, Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python, Django, RESTful APIs, WebSockets
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, TimescaleDB, SQLite, Redis
